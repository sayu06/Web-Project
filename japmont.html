 <p>The first month of the year is characterized 
by the most important event in Japan’s calendar,
 the Japanese New Year.<br><br>
 
 Typically, families will decorate their porch,
 or household shrine, don traditional Japanese 
 clothing, eat ozōni and head out to a shrine or 
 temple for hatsumōde, which means the first shrine
 visit of the year. It’s also common to rise early 
 to watch the first sunrise of the year.

 <p>In Japanese, February is called "Nigatsu" 
 (二月). "Ni" means "two" and "gatsu" means "month",
 so February is literally 
 "the second month" of the year.<br><br>
 
 February in Japan is still considered a
 cold month, but towards the end of the month,
 signs of spring start to appear, such as plum 
 blossoms and early cherry blossoms. Valentine's Day
 is also celebrated on February 14th in Japan, but with a twist: traditionally, women give chocolates to men, and there are different types of chocolates depending on the relationship
 between the giver and receiver.

			<p>In Japanese, March is called "Sangatsu" (三月). "San" means "three" and "gatsu" means "month", so March is literally

 March is a time of change in Japan, 
 as it marks the end of the academic and
 fiscal year for many businesses and schools.
 Graduation ceremonies for high school and university students take place in early March, followed by entrance ceremonies
 for new students at the beginning of April.<br><br>
 
 In terms of weather, March is a transitional month from winter to spring, and the cherry blossoms (sakura) start to bloom towards the end of 
 the month in some parts of Japan.<br><br>

<p>In Japan, the month of April 
is significant for several reasons.
 It marks the beginning of the fiscal year and academic 
 year in Japan, and many companies and schools start their
 operations from April 1st. This period is called "Shin-Gakki" or "New School Year."
			
			<br><br>
 Another significant event that takes
 place in April in Japan is the arrival
 of spring and the blooming of cherry blossoms.
 This is a major cultural event in Japan, and people often gather in parks for "Hanami," which is the tradition of having picnics under 
 the blooming cherry blossom trees.
 <br><br>
 
 Additionally, there are several public holidays 
 in Japan in April, including Showa Day on April 29th,
 which commemorates the birthday of former Emperor Showa 
 (Hirohito) and is a time for reflection 
 on Japan's modern history.<br><br>
