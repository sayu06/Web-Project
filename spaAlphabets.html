    <p><h1><b>How many letters are there in the Spanish alphabet?</b></h1></p>
        <p><h2>The only difference between the English and Spanish written alphabets is that Spanish has 27 letters, while English has only 26.</h2></p>
            <p><h2> The great news about the Spanish alphabet is that, from a reading perspective, it’s essentially the Latin alphabet we know and love.</h2></p> 
            <p><h2> That’s the alphabet used in English, amongst many other languages – from the Germanic and Romance language families, and beyond.</h2></p>
