                     which marks the end of winter. It is also known as Pancake Week.
                    Maslenitsa is celebrated during the week preceding the Great Fast, usually in mid- or late February.
                     A straw doll, sledding, festivities and, of course, pancakes are the main features of Maslenitsa. Pancakes
                      used to have ritual significance and were the symbol of the sun. Following the adoption of Christianity,
                       new religious holidays were introduced, but the festive Maslenitsa continued to exist and is still alive up to now.
                        During the pancake week, the city restaurants and cafes offer pancakes, served with tea, traditional hot sbiten
                         (a Russian drink of water, honey and spices), or medovukha (mead). .

     <div class="text">The Reindeer Herder’s Festival is a one-day holiday, celebrated annually in the main cities and 
        villages in the Yamalo-Nenets region in the Russian Arctic. For the nomadic Nenets people, a festival day is a major 
        event, which offers a chance to meet with friends and compete in contests of physical skill and a variety of other 
        competitions.

        It has also become an event in which the Nenets are able to share with the world a fascinating slice of their unique
         culture, which has remained relatively unchanged throughout the centuries. On this tour not only will you witness the 
         Reindeer Herders' Festival in Yamal but you will also stay with a Nenet family far from the city, giving you an amazing 
         opportunity to fully immerse
         yourself in the nomadic way of life and if you are lucky enough, to witness Northern Lights.
